# Hello world
## Lab overview
- Welcome to Introduction to Programming. For the labs, you will use the Python programming language.
- In this lab, you will write your first Python program

- Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Programming languages are used to write instructions for computers. High-level means that Python commands are written with a combination of English words and special symbols. General-purpose means that Python is used by many people for different types of applications, such as desktop applications and websites.
- Python has two major releases in use today, which are known as Python version 2.x and Python version 3.x. For Introduction to Programming, you will use Python version 3.6.x. Backward compatibility means that legacy code continues to work in new versions of the language. Generally, Python remains backward compatible within minor version releases. However, the major versions have syntax incompatibilities between them, such as between Python version 2.x and Python version 3.x.
- The python.org website has installers and general documentation for Python.
- Most systems will have one or more versions of Python installed, with Python version 2.7 as the default.
