# Monitor an EC2 Instance
## Objectives
- After completing this lab, you should be able to:

1. Create an Amazon SNS notification
2. Configure a CloudWatch alarm
3. Stress test an EC2 instance
4. Confirm that an Amazon SNS email was sent
5. Create a CloudWatch dashboard

## Lab overview
- Logging and monitoring are techniques implemented to achieve a common goal. They work together to help ensure that a system's performance baselines and security guidelines are always met. 
- Logging refers to recording and storing data events as log files. Logs contain low-level details that can give you visibility into how your application or system performs under certain circumstances. From a security standpoint, logging helps security administrators identify red flags that are easily overlooked in their system.
- Monitoring is the process of analyzing and collecting data to help ensure optimal performance. Monitoring helps detect unauthorized access and helps align your services' usage with organizational security.
- In this lab, you create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that initiates when the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance exceeds a specific central processing unit (CPU) utilization threshold. You create a subscription using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) that sends an email to you if this alarm is goes off. You log in to the EC2 instance and run a stress test command that causes the CPU utilization of the EC2 instance to reach 100 percent.
- This test simulates a malicious actor gaining control of the EC2 instance and spiking the CPU. CPU spiking has various possible causes, one of which is malware.

## Summary of task 1
- In this task, you created an SNS topic and then created a subscription for the topic by using an email address. This topic is now able to send alerts to the email address that you associated with the Amazon SNS subscription.
