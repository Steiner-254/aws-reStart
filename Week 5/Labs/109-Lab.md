#  Numeric data types
## Working with Numeric Data Types
## Lab overview
- Python makes it easier to do math. In fact, Python is a popular language among data scientists, who must analyze large amounts of data. In this lab, you will explore the basic data types that are used to store numeric values.
- In this lab, you will:

1. Use the `Python shell`
2. Use the `int` data type
3. Use the `float` data type
4. Use the `complex` data type
5. Use the `bool` data type

- To enter the Python shell, enter the following command:

```
python3
```

- To exit the Python shell, enter the following command:

```
quit()
```

## Introducing the int data type
- To learn more about data types, you will use some built-in functions. A function is a piece of reusable code with a name. You use a function by:

>> Calling by its name

>> Including a list of one or more inputs called arguments, which are enclosed in parentheses

>> Python has several built-in functions that you can use to help you write more useful programs.

- A collection of functions is called a library. Pythonâ€™s collection of built-in functions is called the Python Standard Library.
