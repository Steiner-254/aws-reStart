# Analysis && AWS Trusted Advisor && Security Best Practices
- ***Day 2 Tuesday***

# Analysis
- You will learn how to:

>> Define security analysis and why it is necessary

>> Identify tools and processes for security analysis

>> Describe how different types of testing, monitoring, and logging support security analysis

- As a review, the phases of the security lifecycle consist of:

1. `Prevention` – Is the first line of defense.
2. `Detection` – Occurs when prevention fails.
3. `Response` – Describes what you do when you detect a security threat.
4. `Analysis` – Completes the cycle as you identify lessons learned and implement new measures to prevent the issue from occurring again in the future

## What is analysis?
- Reviewing what happened after a security breach

## Root cause analysis (RCA)
- RCA is used to identify the origin of security breaches.
