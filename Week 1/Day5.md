- ***Day 5 Friday***

## Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
- ***In this module, you will learn how to do the following:***
- Describe the purpose and benefits of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
- Explain the basic pricing that Amazon S3 uses

## Managed cloud storage solution
- Data is stored as objects in buckets.
- Storage is virtually unlimited –> A single object can be up to 5 TB.
- Amazon S3 is designed for 11 9s (99.999999999 percent) of durability.
- Customers have granular access to bucket and objects.

- Objects can be almost any data file, such as documents, images, or videos. When you add objects to a bucket, you must give them a unique name, which is called an object key. Amazon S3 is object-level storage. If you want to change a part of a file, you must make the change and then re-upload the entire modified file.
- Buckets are logical containers for objects. You can have one or more buckets in your account. For each bucket, you can control access regarding who can create, delete, and list objects in the bucket. You can view access logs for the bucket and its objects, and you can choose the geographical region where Amazon S3 stores the bucket and its contents.
- To upload your data, create a bucket in one of the AWS Regions, and then upload any number of objects to the bucket. You can virtually store as many objects as you want within a bucket, and you can write, read, and delete objects in your bucket. A single object can be up to 5 terabytes (TB) in size.
- Amazon S3 is designed to scale seamlessly and provide over 11 9s (99.999999999 percent) of durability. The data that you store in Amazon S3 is not associated with any particular server, and you don’t need to manage any infrastructure yourself.
