- Maintains the list of tests that are needed to verify the behavior for each previously released feature
- Runs all tests and investigates any failures
- Documents the steps to replicate bugs or issues in the application for the developer
- Assists in creating the acceptance criteria, which are the performance criteria that are used to measure successful completion of the application

## Software Developer
- Writes the code that makes up the application according to the specifications that the analyst provides
- Maintains previous versions of the application if they are still supported
- Runs initial test cases to ensure that the product works
- Writes code to fix and address bugs or other issues that are reported to them

## Database administrator
- Maintains the data that is needed in the application
- Is responsible for planning, maintaining, and configuring access to that data and for ensuring the availability of enough computing resources to make an application work correctly
- Secures the data in the database
- Backs up data (and restores data as needed)
- Is responsible for database performance and optimization

## Effective software teams
- The following are some general guidelines: 
1. Translate goals into a clear definition of work.

4. Document important decisions and any required project knowledge.
5. Encourage two-way feedback.â€¢Use time wisely.


## Questions ???
1. Which team member `tests` an application?
- Quality assurance team members run all tests and investigate any failures.
- The Software developer runs all initial test cases to ensure that the product works.

2. Which team member `secures the data in the database`?
- The database administrator ensures the security of the data in the database.


## What is Cloud Computing?
- Cloud computing is the on-demanddelivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources.
- These resources are delivered through a cloud services platform through the internet with pay-as-you-gopricing.
- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources. These resources are delivered through a cloud services platform through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- In its most basic definition, the cloud is a computer that is located somewhere else, accessed through the internet, and used in some way. Web services is another name for what people call the cloud.
- The cloud comprises server computers in large data centers in different locations around the world. When you use a cloud service like Amazon Web Services (AWS), you use the computers that AWS owns. 
- The computers contain various technology features and services, which are like building blocks that you can use to assemble solutions. These solutions help users meet their business goals and technology requirements. With cloud computing, organizations can consume on-demand computing and storage resources instead of building, operating, and improving infrastructure on their own.
