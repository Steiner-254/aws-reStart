- The Software developer runs all initial test cases to ensure that the product works.

2. Which team member `secures the data in the database`?
- The database administrator ensures the security of the data in the database.


## What is Cloud Computing?
- Cloud computing is the on-demanddelivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources.
- These resources are delivered through a cloud services platform through the internet with pay-as-you-gopricing.
- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources. These resources are delivered through a cloud services platform through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- In its most basic definition, the cloud is a computer that is located somewhere else, accessed through the internet, and used in some way. Web services is another name for what people call the cloud.
- The cloud comprises server computers in large data centers in different locations around the world. When you use a cloud service like Amazon Web Services (AWS), you use the computers that AWS owns. 
- The computers contain various technology features and services, which are like building blocks that you can use to assemble solutions. These solutions help users meet their business goals and technology requirements. With cloud computing, organizations can consume on-demand computing and storage resources instead of building, operating, and improving infrastructure on their own.

- Traditional Computing Model.

## Cloud Service Models
1. Iaas - Infrastructure As A Service
2. PaaS - Platform As A Service
3. SaaS - Software As A Service

## 3 Cloud Deployment Models
1. Cloud
2. Hybrid
3. Private (On-Premises)

## What can you do in the cloud?
- ***You can use cloud computing for the following:***
- Application hosting
- Backup and storage
- Content delivery•
- Websites
- Enterprise IT
- Databases


# Advantages Of Cloud Computing
- ***How does cloud computing benefit you?*** 
>> Cloud computing gives you access to servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the internet. Cloud storage is a good example of cloud computing. Cloud storage gives you the option to freeup memory (space) on your computer or mobile device. Imagine a situation where your mobile device runs out of memory when you want to download and save a new song, photo, or video

- ***If you have a business, how can cloud computing benefit your business?***
>> Cloud computing or cloud services providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) provide rapid access to flexible and low-cost IT resources. With cloud computing, you don’t need to make large upfront investments in hardware. As a business owner, you don’t need to purchase a physical location, servers, storage, or databases

- ***Why are so many companies interested in moving to the cloud?*** 
>> Companies are moving to the cloud because it presents many benefits including cost savings because you pay only for the resources that you use.
