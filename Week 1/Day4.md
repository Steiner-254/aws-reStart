## AWS Pricing Model

### Three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS
1. Compute
- Calculated by the hour or second.
- Varies by instance type.

2. Storage
- Charged typically per GB.

3. Data Transfer
- Outbound is aggregated and charged.
- Inbound has no charge.
- Charged per GB.

- AWS has three fundamental drivers of cost: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. These characteristics vary somewhat depending on the AWS offering and pricing model that you choose.
- In most cases,you wonâ€™t becharged for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS services in the same AWS Region. Some exceptions exist,so be sure to verify data transfer rates before you begin to use the AWS service.
- Outbound data transfer is aggregated across servicesand then charged at the outbound data transfer rate. This charge appears on the monthly statement as AWS Data Transfer Out.

## How Do I Pay For AWS?
1. Pay for what you use.
2. Pay less when you reserve.
3. Pay less when you use more and as AWS grows.
