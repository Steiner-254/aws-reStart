# Networking Concepts
- ***Day 3 Wednesday***

- ***You will learn how to:***
- Distinguish between different types of networks
- Describe common network topologies and network management models
- List different types of network protocols

## Types of computer networks
- WAN (Wide Area Network)
- LAN (Local Area Network)
- MAN (Metropolian Area Network)

## Network Topologies
- Physical Topologies
- Logical Topologies

## Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- What is a Amazon VPC?

>> An Amazon VPC is a virtual network that allows you to launch AWS resources that you define. This VPC looks and works just like a normal network within a data center with the benefits of using AWS services for scalability.

## LAN and AWS VPC

- Above is an example of a LAN topology and an AWS VPC network. There are similarities between a LAN and an AWS VPC.

>> Starting from the bottom of the LAN and center for the VPC, they both have nodes or instances.

>> The next layer in the LAN is a switch or subnet, which is also depicted within the VPC as Public and Private subnets.

>> Moving up one layer, there is a router in the LAN directing traffic. The table within the VPC that states the Destination and Target represents the routes that route traffic within and out of the VPC.

## Network management
- A network management model is a representation of how data is managed, and how applications are hosted in a network.
