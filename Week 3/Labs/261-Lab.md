# Public and Private IP addresses
## Objectives
- In this lab, you will:

1. Summarize and investigate the customer scenario
2. Analyze the difference between a private and public IP address
3. Develop a solution to the customer's issue in this lab
4. Summarize and describe your findings (group activity)

## Scenario
- Your role is a `cloud support engineer` at Amazon Web Services (AWS). During your shift, a customer from a Fortune 500 company requests assistance regarding a networking issue within their AWS infrastructure. The following is the email and an attachment regarding their architecture:

- ***Ticket from your customer***:

Hello, Cloud Support!

        We currently have one virtual private cloud (VPC) with a CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/16. In this VPC, we have two Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances: instance A and instance B. Even though both are in the same subnet and have the same configurations with AWS resources, instance A cannot reach the internet, and instance B can reach the internet. I think it has something to do with the EC2 instances, but I'm not sure. I also had a question about using a public range of IP address such as 12.0.0.0/16 for a VPC that I would like to launch. Would that cause any issues? Attached is our architecture for reference.

Thanks!
