What technology enables compute capacity to adjust as loads change?
(1 Point)


A. Load balancing

B. Automatic failover

C. Round robin

D. Auto Scaling

- -> ### **Correct Answer: D. Auto Scaling**  
Auto Scaling enables compute capacity to automatically adjust based on load changes. It ensures that resources are added during high demand and removed during low demand, optimizing performance and cost.

### **Non-Answers:**
- **A. Load balancing:**  
  Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple resources but does not dynamically adjust compute capacity.

- **B. Automatic failover:**  
  Automatic failover redirects traffic or workloads to a standby resource in case of failure, but it does not scale resources based on load.

- **C. Round robin:**  
  Round robin is a load distribution algorithm, often used in load balancing, but it does not scale resources dynamically.
