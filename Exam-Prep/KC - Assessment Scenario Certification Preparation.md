- > Correct Answer:
- ***Data governance, legal requirements***
- Data sovereignty is a legal requirement specific to Germany, focusing on compliance with regional regulations like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). The priority in this scenario is to ensure that the cloud infrastructure adheres to these legal and governance requirements to avoid penalties and ensure proper data handling during audits.

**Incorrect Answers and Why:**
- Services available within the Region

Why it’s incorrect:
While having services available is important, it does not directly address the critical issue of compliance with legal and data governance requirements. Services can exist in a region but still fail to meet the legal criteria required for data sovereignty.

- Customer requirements

Why it’s incorrect:
Customer requirements might include various factors like performance, support, or customization, but these are secondary to complying with the legal mandate of data sovereignty.

- Proximity to customers

Why it’s incorrect:
Proximity can be important for reducing latency or improving service delivery, but it has no bearing on compliance with the legal and governance rules, which is the primary concern in this scenario.
