### 

- **AWS Lambda** is an event-driven, serverless Function as a Service provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services. It is designed to enable developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It executes code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code.
- AWS Pricing Model - AWS priotizes Pay-As-You-Go pricing model.

- Horizontal vs. Vertical scaling

>> Horizontal scaling adds more computers to a system to increase capacity. Vertical scaling adds more resources to a single computer. 

- Amazon Inspector automatically discovers workloads, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and Lambda functions, and scans them for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.
- An "EC2 Instance Usage Report" is a detailed breakdown of your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance usage, displaying information like the number of hours each instance was running, the cost associated with that usage, and often allowing you to filter by specific time periods or instance types, essentially providing a comprehensive overview of your EC2 spending and resource utilization.
- CloudTrail records important information about each action, including who made the request, the services used, the actions performed, parameters for the actions, and the response elements returned by the AWS service.
- AWS Trusted Advisor provides real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.
- **AWS Snowball** is a service that allows users to transfer large amounts of data to and from Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses secure devices to help address challenges with large-scale data transfers. 
- **AWS Health** provides ongoing visibility into your resource performance and the availability of your AWS services and accounts. You can use AWS Health events to learn how service and resource changes might affect your applications running on AWS.
- **AWS Support Concierge** Support Concierge provides account and billing analysis to help cut costs
- **AWS OpsWorks** is a configuration management service that helps you automate the management of applications and servers in the AWS cloud. It uses automation platforms like Chef and Puppet to manage servers across Amazon EC2 instances.
- **AWS decoupling** is the practice of breaking down integrated components in a system so they can operate independently. This architectural approach can improve flexibility, scalability, and resilience. 
- **AWS Consolidated billing** is a billing method that combines multiple invoices into one. It can help businesses and customers save time and money by simplifying the billing process. 
- **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** is a block-level storage service that lets you create and attach storage volumes to Amazon EC2 instances.
- **Amazon Connect** is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud customer contact center service. Amazon Connect enables customer service representatives to respond to phone calls or chat inquiries from end customers just as if the contact center infrastructure was set up and managed on premises.
- **Amazon Route 53** is a highly available and scalable cloud domain name system (DNS) service. Enables to customize DNS routing policies to reduce latency.
- **Amazon Aurora** is a global-scale relational database service built for the cloud with full MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility.
- **AWS Security team** is responsible for the security of all Amazon Web Services (AWS) services. They create and maintain security models, develop security tools, and respond to security incidents.
- **AWS Concierge team** is a group of senior customer service representatives who are assigned to accounts that subscribe to certain Amazon Web Services (AWS) support plans.
- **AWS Trust & Safety team** is responsible for investigating and resolving abuse of AWS resources.
- **Customers use Amazon CloudFront to stream video to viewers** across the globe using a wide variety of protocols that are layered on top of HTTP. The Amazon Content Delivery Network (CDN) can be used with AWS Elemental Media Services to implement two different types of video streaming.
- **AWS Quick Starts** are automated reference architectures that streamline the deployment of key workloads on the AWS Cloud. They use infrastructure as code to provision production environments on AWS that may require hundreds of discreet procedures to deploy manually.
- **AWS Quick Start reference deployments** are automated architectures that guide users through deploying workloads on AWS. They use AWS CloudFormation templates to launch deployments into accounts. 
- **AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering** automatically stores objects in three access tiers: one tier optimized for frequent access, a lower-cost tier optimized for infrequent access, and a very-low-cost tier optimized for rarely accessed data.
- **AWS S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** is used for backup and disaster recovery use cases.
- **Amazon S3 Standard** is a storage class for data that is accessed frequently. It's the default storage class for Amazon S3. 
- **Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)** is a storage class for data that's accessed infrequently but needs to be available quickly. It's a good choice for long-term storage, backups, and disaster recovery. 
- **AWS Infrastructure Event Management (IEM)** offers architecture and scaling guidance and operational support during the preparation and execution of planned events such as shopping holidays, product launches, or migrations.
- **Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)** helps in database maintainance hence saving time.
- **Amazon Connect** is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud customer contact center service. Amazon Connect enables customer service representatives to respond to phone calls or chat inquiries from end customers just as if the contact center infrastructure was set up and managed on premises.
