#  Network Hardening
- ***Day 3 Wednesday***

- You will learn how to:

>> Identify network security vulnerabilities

>> List network discovery protection mechanisms

>> Describe network architecture hardening practices

## What is network hardening?
- `Network hardening` is the activity in the layered security prevention strategy that focuses on protecting the network.
- The goal is to stop the unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or destruction of a computer network and its resources.

## Network Mapping
- Attackers can use it to find out which devices and hosts are present in the network.

## What is network architecture hardening?
- Network architecture hardening increases the security of a network through design improvements.
- Network architecture hardening is achieved through the following:
1. Adding security components to the network

>> Network firewalls

>> Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs)

2. Segmenting a network

>> Creating private subnets

>> Using network access control lists (network ACLs)

## Network firewall
- A network firewall is a protection mechanism to filter incoming and outgoing traffic in a network.

## AWS security groups
- In the AWS Cloud, a security group implements a firewall to protect EC2 instances.

## Intrusion prevention system (IPS)
- An IPS actively protects a network against threats.
