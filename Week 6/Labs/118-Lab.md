# Preparing to analyze insulin with Python

## Lab overview
- In information technology, Python works well as the programming language of choice for manipulating strings, sequences, and numbers. Python is especially preferred in scientific computing applications such as physics, chemistry, and biology.
- In some of the labs for the Python modules, you will perform simple sequence manipulations and calculations on human insulin, which is a well-known hormone in the human body that is responsible for regulating sugars.
- In this lab, you will:

>> Retrieve the protein sequence of human insulin from human preproinsulin
